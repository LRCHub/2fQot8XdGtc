```lrc
[00:35.49] Take a seat back in your clamshell
[00:40.58] If the oceans not enough, nor am I
[00:46.90] Rollin in, I feel a dark swell
[00:52.39] Crawling up the skin of my spine
[01:08.39] 
[00:59.06] If I'd known you sold on maybe
[01:03.94] I'd a let you waste another guy
[01:10.49] Well alrighty Aphrodite
[01:16.39] Go whip that red for other eyes
[01:31.89] 
[01:33.63] Run your morning bath in sea foam
[01:39.20] Soak your milky skin in the tide
[01:45.66] Little pearl you think you're in gold
[01:50.99] But I can see the dirt in your lines
[02:08.99] 
[01:57.57] If I'd known you sold on maybe
[02:02.99] I'd-a let you waste another guy
[02:09.04] Well alrighty Aphrodite
[02:14.91] Go whip that red for other eyes
[02:30.41] 
[02:45.01] If I'd known you sold on maybe
[02:49.79] I'd a let you waste another guy
[02:55.91] Well alrighty Aphrodite
[03:01.42] Go whip that red for other eyes
